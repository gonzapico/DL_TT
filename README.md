#### Do you want to watch a film?

The goal of this small app is to let the user have a list of the films that in their title have the word "love". Do you want to change the films list? Have a look on the code and change the terms of search.

1. The _Home screen_ shows a list of movies retrieved from the database of OMDB that has the word "love" in the title
2. The _Detail screen_ shows the detail of the film that the user has tapped in.

The app is available for tablet (landscape and portrait) and mobile (just portrait).


Architecture
=================================

I follow the principles of Clean Architecture. 


![Clean Architecture Layers](http://notes.lucida.me/images/clean_arc_android/layers.png)


The apps id divided in three layers:

1. Data
2. Domain
3. Presentation

### Data
We get the films through the _OMDB API_. I use *Retrofit* as a library to manage the API requests.
    
    - It contains repository implementations and data sources.
    - It depends on Domain Layer

### Domain
This layer doesn't care about the others. It has to be implemented in any neutral language (_Java_ or _Kotlin_, for instance) and it doesn't have any reference to the _Android SDK_. The use cases have the responsibility to execute the actions generated by the app or the user.

    - It contains Entities, Use Cases and Repository interfaces.
    - It depends on none Layer

### Presentation
This layer is in charge of showing the information on the screen. It has relationship with the _Android SDK_. Inside of it, we use *MVP (Model - View Presenter)*.
    
    - It contains UI coordinated by the Presenters
    - It depends on Domain Layer

Good practices (SOLID?)
=======================

### Single Responsibility
I follow all through the project. Have a look on the ___MovieViewHolder__ class.

### Depency Injection
*Koin* is the way (library) I followed to do the _Dependency Injection_.

### MVP
The views are interfaces that are implemented by the screen (_Activities_ or _Fragments_) in order to have the less possible code on it just to implement the way to render the information on the screen.




Testing
=======
I use JUnit among Mockito in order to have tests in at least all the layers of the architecture.


---------------------------

#### Tools
* AndroidX
* Material Design
* Picasso
* CardView
* Koin
* Coroutines
    - I use coroutines through all the project to do the communication between layers.

You can check all them out in the _buildsytem/dependencies.gradle_ file

------------------------------

#### What should be done next?

1. Persitency with *Room*
2. UI testing with *Espresso*
